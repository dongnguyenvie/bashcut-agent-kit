# Command reference

<!-- Generated from CommandCatalog by scripts/update-commands.sh. Do not edit by hand. -->

Every automation command, 203 in all. Each is the same command on the CLI (`bashcut …`), as an
MCP tool (`bashcut_<group>_<command>`, same parameter names as JSON-RPC) and over the socket. Modes and
approval are explained in the [automation guide](../guides/automation.md#permission-modes).

## context

### `bashcut context get`

Read the project path, revision, playhead and selection, and a summary of the agent knowledge: active lessons, preferences, project facts and the number of proposals; scope lists the timeline items attached to your tab's request (edit only those), with the scope guard's mode, a held edit and the user's answer to the last one (last); agentPermissions tells what you may do without asking; analysis lists running analysis jobs and the media not yet measured (media.analyze), transcribed (media.transcribe) or described (media.describe), so a plan does not use defaults where measurements are missing; plan summarises the brief (goal, outputs, length) and the edit plan (mode, stage, section/shot/beat counts, frozen sections); workflow.checklist is a compact run checklist and workflow.next {stage, skill, skillRead} names the one skill to read now; recentFailures lists your session's failed requests of the last 15 minutes (method, code, category, message) and repeated, how many in a row at the newest end share a method and category: stop and rethink after repeated ones.

## project

### `bashcut project get`

Read the whole open project document.

- Mode: read · Runs: immediately · MCP: `bashcut_project_get`

### `bashcut project open <path> [--save-current] [--discard-current]`

Open a project.bashcut.json (or its folder). Fails if the open project has unsaved changes unless saveCurrent or discardCurrent is set. Agent tabs stay open; every agent must read the new project (context get or timeline get) before its next edit.

- Mode: edit · Runs: immediately · MCP: `bashcut_project_open`
- `path`: string, required, path. Absolute path to project.bashcut.json or its folder
- `saveCurrent`: boolean, default false. Save the open project first when it has unsaved changes
- `discardCurrent`: boolean, default false. Drop unsaved changes of the open project

### `bashcut project close [--save-current] [--discard-current]`

Close the open project and show the Welcome screen, like File › Close Project. Fails if it has unsaved changes unless saveCurrent or discardCurrent is set. Agent tabs stay open; edits fail until a project is opened or created.

- Mode: edit · Runs: immediately · MCP: `bashcut_project_close`
- `saveCurrent`: boolean, default false. Save the open project first when it has unsaved changes
- `discardCurrent`: boolean, default false. Drop unsaved changes of the open project

### `bashcut project format [--canvas <canvas>] [--clips <clips>] [--resolution <resolution>] [--outputs <outputs>] --base-rev <baseRev>`

Change the open project's canvas like the format menu in the toolbar: portrait 9:16, landscape 16:9 or square, at a short-side resolution (the current one by default); timing is kept and clip pan/tilt scale with the frame. --clips fit shows each clip whole (bars where its shape differs), fill covers the frame and crops; a clip's own `fill` property overrides it. --outputs sets the export presets the project is made for (first one primary): review checks the first one's platform (safe area, longest length, smallest text) and the Export sheet starts with it. Each change is one undoable edit.

### `bashcut project set-data <key> <value.json> [--merge] --base-rev <baseRev>`

Set a top-level project field to a JSON object as one undoable edit; with merge, only the given fields change (null removes one). Identity, format, media and tracks are not data. Core reads only: brief lengthSeconds {min, max} and outputs [names], plan sections [{id, label, lengthSeconds {min, max}, frozen}], shots and beats [{id, text, section}] when present (directly or under value): review compares them with the edit, as info, and context get summarises them so work can resume from them.

Find the time offset between two recordings of the same moment (a camera and a screen recording, or a render played inside a screen recording) from their sound, with an audio.sync provider. The job's result: time in `to` = time in `media` + offsetSeconds, the correlation (below 0.4: no shared sound) and each half of the overlap (steady: no clock drift).

A quote's matched is the share of its words heard in place: under 1 the transcript differs (a misheard word, or a quote that is not there), so read text before using the range. Returns from/to seconds and in/out frames for media place, the text, and per edge midWord, midSentence (inside a transcript phrase) and the nearest word and sentence edges before and after.

Map where an analysed media has sound that may be speech, and the gaps, with the calibration used: the media.analyze level windows (broadband RMS per 0.1 s; digital silence counts as quiet and is left out) are split into quiet and loud by Otsu's method unless thresholdDb is given. calibration {method otsu/given, floorDb, speechDb, separationDb, eta (share of level variance the split explains), otsuThresholdDb, thresholdDb, minSeparationDb, separation clear/weak/none/given}. When the classes are closer than minSeparationDb (noise, music under the voice) separation is none and spans/gaps are null with a reason, instead of made-up silences. Otherwise spans and gaps [{start, end, seconds}] in source seconds, speechSeconds, speechShare, gapStats. With a stored transcript (media.transcribe), transcript {words, spans, gaps, speechSeconds, levelCoveredByWords, wordsCoveredByLevel}. Spans are sound, not proof of speech.

Invariants (gaps, black picture, cut-in-word, missing fonts or glyphs, output length and shape, true peak) are always checked; editorial checks only against the limits in the project's review object, and nothing without them. IDs are anchored to clips. With summary: {issues, summary, checks (measured, stale, notChecked, failed, unreliable, unsetLimits)}; with sinceRev also diff {fixed, new, persisting}.

Add a library item to the timeline as a new item: a text preset (with its stored textStyle and animation) or emoji sticker as text, an image, animated or video-alpha sticker (its file copied into the project's stickers/ folder once per content, imported and placed on the Overlay layer, added when missing, at size and position, as one undo step; an animated sticker shows its first frame for now and the result says so), a look as an adjustment (with its LUT added to the project in the same undo step), or audio: its file copied into the project's music/ or sfx/ folder (once per content), imported and placed on the Music layer (music, ambience) or SFX layer (sfx), the layer added when missing, as one undo step. duration trims a sound; longer than the file, a loopable sound repeats back to back and another plays once (the result says so). A clip (footage) is copied into the project's clips/ folder (once per content), imported and placed like media place: on track or the main layer, spilling onto a free layer when the range is taken, duration trimming it, as one undo step. At the playhead by default.

### `bashcut library analyze <id> [--scope <scope>] [--provider <provider>]`

Measure an audio library item's file and save the values as a new version: its length, integrated loudness and true peak (an audio.loudness provider, as audio measure), landmarks {onset, peak, tail} in seconds (where it passes the −70 LUFS gate, peaks and drops back under it) and, unless it is a sound effect, its tempo in BPM (an audio.beats provider, as beats detect). Runs as a job; a missing provider leaves that value and says why in notes. Agents saving to the user scope wait for approval. Tag mood and genre with library update --tags after listening or reading the analysis.

- Mode: edit · Runs: as a background job (`jobs wait` until it ends) · MCP: `bashcut_library_analyze`
- `id`: string, required. Item ID, or scope:id to pick one scope
- `scope`: string, one of built-in, user, project, plugin. Look only in this scope; without it project, user, plugin, then built-in
- `provider`: string. audio.loudness provider ID; the project's choice by default

### `bashcut library preview [<id>] [--scope <scope>] [--stop]`

Play a library item's sound in BashCut (the Audio panel's play button), stopping any other; stop, or no id, stops it.

- Mode: ui · Runs: immediately · MCP: `bashcut_library_preview`
- `id`: string. Item ID, or scope:id
- `scope`: string, one of built-in, user, project, plugin. Look only in this scope; without it project, user, plugin, then built-in

### `bashcut library search <query> --kind <kind> [--provider <provider>] [--limit <limit>] [--save <save>] [--scope <scope>] [--page <page>] [--request-id <requestId>] [--dry-run]`

Ask an installed plugin that provides library.search (sounds, stickers, GIFs… from Freesound, Giphy or another source) for candidate items of a kind. Runs as a job; its result lists candidates with their fields, downloaded file and preview paths, source and license. Nothing is saved until library add --from-result <job>:<index> (or save here) copies one into the library. Network use is the plugin's.

- Mode: edit · Runs: as a background job (`jobs wait` until it ends) · MCP: `bashcut_library_search`
- `query`: string, required. What to look for
- `kind`: string, required, one of audio, text-preset, sticker, effect-preset, transition-preset, look, voice, clip. Item kind
- `provider`: string. Plugin or provider ID; the first available provider that serves the kind by default
- `limit`: integer, 1…50, default 12. Most candidates to return
- `save`: integer, ≥ 0. Also save the candidate with this index (from 0) when the job finishes
- `scope`: string, one of project, user, default "project". Where save puts it: project (the default) or user (agents need approval)
- `page`: integer, 1…1000, default 1. Result page, from 1
- `requestId`: string. Your stable ID for this request: sending it again returns the same job instead of starting (and paying for) another; the provider receives it too
- `dryRun`: boolean, default false. Return the request as it would go to the provider (without option values), whether the provider is paid and its estimate if it gives one; nothing runs

### `bashcut library generate <prompt> --kind <kind> [--provider <provider>] [--limit <limit>] [--save <save>] [--scope <scope>] [--params <params>] [--request-id <requestId>] [--dry-run]`

Ask an installed plugin that provides library.generate (AI music, stickers…) to make candidate items of a kind from a prompt. Runs as a job; its result lists candidates like library search. Nothing is saved until library add --from-result <job>:<index> (or save here) copies one into the library.

- `path`: string, required, path. Pack folder or .zip
- `scope`: string, one of project, user, default "project". project (the open project's .bashcut/library; the default) or user (this Mac; agents need approval)
- `replace`: boolean, default false. Save items whose ID exists as new versions

### `bashcut library export-pack --output <output> [--pack <pack>] [--kind <kind>] [--scope <scope>] [--name <name>]`

Write library items as a pack folder (pack.json and files) to share or import elsewhere: one pack, or every item of a kind or scope. Refuses, naming them, when an item's own licence says redistribute false; unknownLicenses lists items exported whose licence does not say.

## fonts

### `bashcut fonts list [--query <query>] [--project] [--language <language>] [--covers]`

List fonts for text items (Inspector › Text › Font): the project's fonts folder first, then the fonts installed on this Mac, with PostScript names (textStyle.font) and, for the content language (or --language), whether each has every letter of it (covers).

### `bashcut fonts import <path>`

Copy a .ttf, .otf or .ttc font into the project's fonts folder and use it for this project (Inspector › Text › Font › Add Font…). The font travels with the project; nothing is installed on the Mac.

- Mode: edit · Runs: immediately · MCP: `bashcut_fonts_import`
- `path`: string, required, path. Font file
