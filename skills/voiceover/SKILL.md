name: voiceover
description: Write and produce voiceover in BashCut — measure the voice's speaking rate and the speech-free windows, size each line to its window, prepare the text so text-to-speech reads it right, synthesize takes with a voice.synthesize provider (for example VieNeu-TTS for Vietnamese, preset or cloned voices), check every take against its text, fit it to the picture, re-take one line in place, and dub or localise existing speech. Use for narration, voiceover, fixing a flubbed line without re-recording, dubbing, or when the user says "lồng tiếng", "thuyết minh", "đọc lời", "giọng AI", "clone giọng", "text to speech", "TTS", "dịch lồng tiếng", "lồng tiếng tiếng Anh".

# Voiceover

Reply in the user's language. Commands measure and act; the numbers below are ranges with their source, to
choose from with the measurements in hand. Measure → change → measure again.

## Provider and voice

`voice speak` uses the project's `voice.synthesize` provider. Check with `capabilities get voice.synthesize`:
`reason: missing` → `plugins search --capability voice.synthesize` and ask the user to install one (for Vietnamese:
VieNeu TTS); `not_configured` → tell the user what the provider's `detail` says (turn it on, trust it again);
`unhealthy` → the failing dependency is in `detail`.

```sh
bashcut voice voices                                   # per voice: language, region, style, gender, supportsRate, measuredRate; per provider: clones
bashcut plugins options bashcut.vieneu-tts
bashcut plugins option bashcut.vieneu-tts --option voice --value <voice>
```

- Pick voices by their facts (language, region, style, measured rate), then audition 2–3 on the **hardest** line,
  not the first; the first voice is rarely the pick (T10 §2).
- Cloning: only the user's own voice or one whose owner agreed. A provider that `clones` refuses without
  `--clone-consent`; pass it only when the user said yes in this conversation, never by default (T10 §6). If
  viewers could take the AI voice for a real recording, suggest disclosing it.

## 1. Measure before writing

There is no normal speaking rate: it varies by voice, language, genre and energy (T10 §3). Measure it in the
content language's unit (syllables for Vietnamese, characters for Chinese/Japanese/Korean, else words):

```sh
bashcut speech rate                        # each speaker in the transcribed footage: p10/p50/p90, overall, articulation
bashcut speech rate --voice PROVIDER/VOICE # the rates measured on that voice's earlier takes
```

- A voice with no measured rate yet: synthesize one test line (`--keep-takes`) and read its `unitsPerSecond`.
- When the voiceover should sound like the creator, size lines from the creator's own measured rate.
- Never reuse an English words-per-second figure for a syllable language (T10 §3).

Then find where voiceover can go and how much text fits:

```sh
bashcut narration windows --min-seconds S --rate R     # speech-free windows; with rate, a unit budget each
```

Each window comes with what covers it (music, footage, silence), the shots under it and anchors (last word
before it, first cut, first beat). Write each line to its window's budget; the p10–p90 spread of the voice tells
you how much slack to leave. If a line does not fit, **cut text** first; do not plan to speed the voice
(T02 §4). TTS length drifts from any plan (a 50 s script came out 40–45 s, T10 §3), so the final timing comes
from the generated take, not from the script.

## 2. Prepare the text

Spell out what gets misread:
- Numbers, years, times: `2026` → "hai nghìn không trăm hai mươi sáu", `7h30` → "bảy giờ ba mươi". Captions
  keep the digits (T10 §2).
- Units and symbols: km, %, °C, `k` (nghìn đồng).
- Acronyms as letters ("xê en xê" for CNC); show them as letters again in captions.
- English or unusual words: rephrase in plain words rather than respelling ("chill" was read "chiều").
- Very short exclamations (≤ 5 words) with an expressive voice fail often; use a calm voice or a longer line.

When a phrase is misread in every take, **rewording beats regenerating** ("kín xe" → "chật cứng xe"). Change
approved text minimally and tell the user which words changed.

## 3. Synthesize

```sh
bashcut voice speak "Text of one line" --takes 3 --at-frame F --target-rate R   # job; inserts the take closest to R
bashcut voice speak "Text" --takes 6 --keep-takes                                # keep every take, insert nothing
bashcut jobs wait JOB_ID --timeout 25                                            # repeat until done; every take's facts and file
```

- Each take reports `seconds`, `units`, `unitsPerSecond`, `leadingSilence`, `trailingSilence`, `pauses` and its
  file. Choose by `--target-rate` (the rate you sized the line with), `--choose N` (a take you picked from the
  facts), or else the provider's score. Core holds no pace formula: the choice is yours.
- One call per line or short paragraph at its window; it becomes one undoable edit and the item keeps its text.
- Give every call a stable `--request-id` (`vo-<section>-<n>`). A paid provider: `--dry-run` first and show the
  user its `estimate`; the job's `usage` reports what it charged.
- Takes: 3–6, more for short or expressive lines (T10 §3).
- A take whose rate is far from the voice's measured rate (video-recap flags beyond about ±30 %, T10 §3) has
  likely dropped, repeated or invented words: check it first.
- Style or emotion directives: compare with a neutral take of the same text. One source treats +25 % duration as
  "took effect" and < 5 % as "not applied" (jianshuo, T10 §3); listen as well.
- With `--keep-takes`, place a take with `media import /abs/take.wav --kind audio --place --track VOICEOVER_TRACK
  --at-frame F --base-rev N`.

## 4. Check every kept take

```sh
bashcut voice check --item ITEM            # job: similarity, words matched/substituted/missing, extra words
bashcut voice check --media MEDIA --text "The text it should say"
```

The model misreads, drops or repeats words, mostly **at the start** of a line. Read `words` and `extra`, not
only `similarity`: a repeated word barely moves it. Pass `--min-similarity` only when you want a pass/fail flag
(one kit gates at 0.92 for Chinese, T10 §3); the call is yours. Recognition also mishears some regional accents
(s→x, final n→ng): count only errors a listener would hear. Fix by rewording or a re-take.

## 5. Fit to picture

Fix in order of naturalness (T10 §4, jianshuo ladder):

1. **Shorten or reword the text**, then re-take.
2. **Provider rate**, when the voice `supportsRate` (jianshuo slows −12…−15 % before stretching, T10 §3).
3. **Stretch with pitch kept**, within bounds you pass:
   ```sh
   bashcut voice fit --item ITEM --to-frame F --min-ratio MIN --max-ratio MAX --base-rev N
   ```
   Outside the bounds nothing changes and the error gives the speed it would need. Ranges seen: slowing to
   0.82–0.95 (floors 0.82 jianshuo, 0.85 digitalsamba; imperceptible above ~0.92); speeding up to about 1.1 and
   only after rewriting failed (T10 §3). How much stretch goes unheard varies with the voice's timbre and how
   much music masks it (T10 §3).
4. **Change the text more**, with the user's consent (it changes the captions).

Silence at a line end is often better than a stretched voice. Ranges seen: tail after the last word 0.1–0.5 s,
longer before a cut or reveal; gaps between sentences 0.2–0.8 s, up to 1–3 s after a key line (T10 §3).

- Never over real speech. Keep a gap from real voices (0.3 s worked in our edits); set the project's
  `review.voiceoverMarginSeconds` so `review run` checks it.
- Give each voiceover section b-roll longer than the line: a too-short source clip made the voiceover run into the
  next spoken cut.
- Captions for voiceover: write them from your text (`bc:captions-text`); `voice speak` times the item's captions
  from the take.
- Level: judged against the music, not one number. Measure both (`audio measure --media ID`: loudness and
  `presenceShare`) and set the balance with `bc:audio-mix`, which holds the ranges and sources.

## 6. Re-take one line

```sh
bashcut voice speak --replace ITEM --takes 3 --target-rate R          # same text, new take in place
bashcut voice speak "Reworded line" --replace ITEM --takes 3          # new text
```

The new take keeps the item's place and its captions are timed again. Check it (`voice check --item ITEM`) and
fit it again if its length changed.

## 7. Dubbing and localisation

1. **Transcribe** the original (`media transcribe --media ID`, then `media transcript --media ID`) and measure
   both rates: the original speaker (`speech rate --media ID`) and the target voice.
2. **Translate** per cue, keeping cue boundaries at sentence ends. Languages differ in length (Mandarin takes
   60–80 % of the time Spanish does, jianshuo, T10 §2), so size each cue from the target voice's measured rate.
3. **Sample one cue first**: the most performance-sensitive one, not the first. Get the user's yes on voice and
   pace before batching (OpenMontage, T10 §2).
4. **Per cue, fit ladder**: shorten the text → re-take → `voice fit` within bounds → move the cue
   (`timeline move ITEM --track TRACK --at-frame F --base-rev N`) into nearby silence. Tell the user which cues
   were shortened (it changes the meaning) and which moved.
5. **Keep the original audio as a bed** under the dub, not muted: jianshuo keeps it at 0.15–0.25 linear
   (≈ −16…−12 dB, T10 §3); set it with `volumeDb` and check with `bc:audio-mix`.
6. Check every cue (`voice check`), then re-time captions from the takes.
